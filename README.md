Facebook Logout Button
==========

Facebook hides the logout button inside it's rollover menu, and makes
it hard to logout of facebook. This script will just bring the logout
button to the navigation menu and place it beside the *Home*
link. Nothing fancy, just an easy way to logout of facebook, for the
addicted.

I am unable to make it install directly from github, but if you know
how to install greasemonkey scripts, you can try it out.

TODO
----------
* Make the button more or less similar in style to it's siblings
